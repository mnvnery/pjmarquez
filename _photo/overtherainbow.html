project_description: "\"Under the Rainbow\" is about Olaias, a housing complex built
  in the 1980s on the outskirts of Lisbon (Portugal). Its construction was an attempt
  to bring happiness to the Portuguese people, fresh out of the gray years of the
  dictatorship. It was the arrival of a new order: the capitalist utopia. \n\n<br><br>\n\nPhotoEspa√±a
  selected this project for \"Descubrimientos PHE21\""
