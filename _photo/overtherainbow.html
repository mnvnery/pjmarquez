project_description: A tree falls and crushes me during a heavy storm. I'm on
  Yanomami land, in the Amazon rainforest. Thanks to a series of magical events,
  I survive. When I return home to Lisbon, I discover that my daily
  rehabilitation will be at Olaias, an architectural complex built on the
  outskirts of the city. I've always wanted to photograph Olaias.
