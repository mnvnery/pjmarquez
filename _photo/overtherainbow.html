project_description: "\"As Olaias\" is a housing complex built in the 1980s on the
  outskirts of Lisbon (Portugal). \n\n<br><br>\n\nIts construction was an attempt
  to bring happiness to the Portuguese people, fresh out of the gray years of the
  dictatorship. It was the arrival of a new order: the capitalist utopia.\n\n<br><br>\n\n_PhotoEspa√±a
  selected this project for \"Descubrimientos PHE21\"_"
