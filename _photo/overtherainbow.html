project_description: A tree falls and crushes me during a heavy storm. I'm in
  the Amazon rainforest. Thanks to a series of magical events, I survive. When I
  return home to Lisbon, I discover that my daily rehabilitation will be at
  Olaias, an architectural complex built on the outskirts of the city. I've
  always wanted to photograph Olaias.
