project_description:
  - A tree falls and crushes me during a heavy storm in the forest. Thanks to a
    series of magical events, I survive. When I return home, I discover that my
    daily rehabilitation will be at Olaias, an architectural complex built on
    the outskirts of the city. I've always wanted to photograph Olaias.
