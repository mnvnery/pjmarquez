project_description: |-
  "As Olaias" is a housing complex built in the 1980s on the outskirts of Lisbon (Portugal).

  <br><br>

  Its construction was an attempt to bring happiness to the Portuguese people, fresh out of the gray years of the dictatorship. It was the arrival of a new order: the capitalist utopia.
