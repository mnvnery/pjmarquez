project_description: >-
  "As Olaias" is a housing complex built in the 1980s on the outskirts of Lisbon
  (Portugal).


  Its construction was an attempt to bring happiness to the Portuguese people, fresh out of the gray years of the dictatorship. It was the arrival of a new order: the capitalist utopia.
