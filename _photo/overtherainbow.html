project_description: 
  - A tree falls and crushes me during a heavy storm in the
    forest. Thanks to a series of magical events, I survive. When I return home, I
    discover that my daily rehabilitation will be at Olaias, an architectural
    complex built on the outskirts of the city. I've always wanted to photograph
    Olaias.
