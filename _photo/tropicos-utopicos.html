  “Versatile cinematographer Pedro J. Márquez ensure audiences form a close rapport with the protagonist", was the highlight given by Variety to his work in the Brazilian family drama "Como Nossos País", directed by Laís Bodanzky and premiered in the Panorama Section of the Berlin International Film Festival in 2017.

  The ability to adapt to different proposals and, at the same time, achieve a connection with the most intimate core of each story is, precisely, one of the challenges that Pedro always pursues in his work.

  In "Ex-Shaman", by Luiz Bolognesi, a film about the ethnocide suffered by an indigenous community in Amazonas, his work once again attracts Variety's attention: “What’s not conjectural is the photographic beauty of the widescreen images, shot by Pedro J. Márquez with a timeless stillness that seems to resist the race toward change that began in 1969 and has caused so much destruction ever since".
